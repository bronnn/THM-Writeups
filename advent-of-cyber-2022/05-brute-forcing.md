# Day 5 Brute Forcing - He knows when you're awake

## Use Hydra to find the VNC password of the target with IP address 10.10.192.241. What is the password?

I am using [Threader 3000](https://github.com/dievus/threader3000) to scan all ports of the machine.

From running the above nmap scan, we discover there is a vnc service running on port 5900.  
As stated by the hint, the VNC server does not use a username. We can use Hydra to bruteforce the login using the rockyou wordlist

We have now successfully brute forced the password for vnc and can attempt to login.

## Using a VNC client on the AttackBox, connect to the target of IP address 10.10.192.241. What is the flag written on the targetâ€™s screen?

We can use the remote desktop client Remmina to connect to the target machine. 

I launched Remmina by simply typing 'remmina' in the terminal. Clicking cancel on the keyring popup brought me straight to the main page of Remmina.  
Here I was able to input our target ip and change the connection to VNC.

Next we simply enter the password we brute forced earlier, and we are in :)

You will be able to retrieve the flag from the bottom right of the target machine's desktop
